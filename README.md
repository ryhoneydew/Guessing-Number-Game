# Guessing-number-game
The user guesses a number between 1-100. The app should respond and indicate if their guess is 'hot' or 'cold' 
based on how close the guess is to the number they are trying to guess. The game should also keep track of previous 
guesses, and give the user a way to reset the game, or get a hint.
